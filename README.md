 Week 1 Exercise Repository

This repository is a comprehensive collection of exercises and projects that were completed as part of Week 1 in the Weekly assignment submission of CTS. The exercises span a variety of topics, including data structures and algorithms (DSA), design patterns, and practical Java applications. Each project is designed to reinforce key concepts and provide hands-on experience in software development.

 Data Structures and Algorithms

A significant portion of this repository focuses on implementing various data structures and algorithms in Java. These exercises are structured around real-world scenarios, such as managing an e-commerce platform, an employee management system, financial forecasting, and more. Each project is designed to explore different aspects of DSA, from searching algorithms like binary and linear search to more complex system management like inventory and library management.

For instance, the `EcommercePlatform` project demonstrates how binary and linear search algorithms can be applied to find products within a catalog. Similarly, the `EmployeeManagementSystem` provides insights into organizing and retrieving employee data efficiently. These exercises not only help in understanding the theoretical aspects of algorithms but also in applying them to practical, everyday programming tasks.

 Design Patterns

The repository also includes several examples of design patterns, which are crucial for writing clean, efficient, and reusable code. Each design pattern is explored through a dedicated project. For example, the `ObserverPatternExample` project simulates a stock market where different observers (like web apps) react to changes in stock prices. The `ProxyPatternExample` and `SingletonPatternExample` demonstrate how to manage object creation and control access to resources in a system.

These design pattern examples are written in a way that emphasizes their practical use cases, making it easier to grasp their significance in software design and architecture. Whether you’re new to design patterns or looking to reinforce your understanding, these examples serve as a solid foundation.

 Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you'll need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. Each project is self-contained and can be compiled and run using a Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or even via the command line. The code is written with clarity in mind, making it accessible for learners at various levels.

 Conclusion

This Week 1 repository reflects the initial steps in a broader learning journey. It covers essential topics in software development, providing a mix of theory and practice. Whether you’re here to explore data structures and algorithms, understand design patterns, or simply improve your Java programming skills, this repository offers valuable exercises that are both educational and engaging. Feel free to dive into the projects, experiment with the code, and build upon what’s provided here.

 Week 2 Exercise Repository

Welcome to the Week 2 Exercise Repository! This collection of files is part of my coursework, where I delved into both Java-based web development and PL/SQL scripting. The repository is divided into two main sections: a Maven-based Library Management System and a series of PL/SQL scripts.

 Library Management System Projects

In this repository, you'll find two versions of a Library Management System project. Both versions are developed using Java, but each version reflects different stages of the project, showcasing the evolution of the system.

The more recent version, found in the `LibraryManagement 9` folder, is built using Spring Boot, a powerful framework that simplifies the development of Java applications. This project manages the basic operations of a library, such as adding new books, retrieving book information, updating details, and removing books. The structure includes a variety of Java files organized into controllers, services, and repositories. Additionally, it utilizes Maven for dependency management, ensuring that all necessary libraries are included and up-to-date. If you're familiar with Java and Spring Boot, this project should be straightforward to understand and run.

The earlier version of the project, located in the `LibraryManagement-8` folder, has a similar purpose but a slightly different structure and implementation. This version might be interesting if you're curious to see how the project has progressed and refined over time.

 PL/SQL Scripts

The second part of this repository is a collection of PL/SQL scripts. These scripts are designed to perform various database operations, demonstrating control structures, cursor handling, error management, and more. They also include practical examples such as stored procedures, triggers, and functions, which are essential for managing and manipulating data within a database. For anyone working with Oracle databases or interested in learning PL/SQL, these scripts provide a valuable resource.

In addition to the scripts, there’s a document (`Week 2_PLSQL.docx`) that provides further explanations and context, making it easier to understand the purpose and usage of each script.

 Getting Started

If you're interested in running the Library Management System projects, you'll need Java (JDK 8 or higher) and Maven installed on your machine. The PL/SQL scripts require an Oracle database or any compatible SQL environment. Detailed instructions for running these projects are included in the repository, but if you’re familiar with these technologies, it should be a breeze to get started.

 Final Thoughts

This repository represents a significant step in my learning journey, and I hope it serves as a helpful resource for others as well. Whether you're here to explore Java web development with Spring Boot or to dive into PL/SQL scripting, I believe you'll find something valuable. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out!


 Week 3 Exercise Projects

This repository contains multiple Java projects related to Week 3 exercises. Each exercise is located in its respective directory and focuses on different aspects of Java programming, including Spring Boot applications and other related technologies.

- Ex-1 to Ex-4: These exercises might be basic setups, configurations, or simpler Java applications demonstrating fundamental concepts.
- Ex-5: Employee Management System project focusing on CRUD operations and possibly integrating a database.
- Ex-6: Another iteration or enhancement of the Employee Management System.
- Ex-7 to Ex-10: Likely more complex projects, potentially including advanced topics like auditing, JPA configurations, projections, and other Spring Boot features.

 How to Run

To run any of these exercises:

1. Navigate to the directory of the exercise you wish to run.
2. Ensure you have Java and Maven installed on your machine.
3. Use the following Maven command to build and run the project:

   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. For exercises that involve tests, you can run the tests using:

   ```sh
   mvn test
   ```

 Prerequisites
